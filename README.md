# NoteKeeper
NoteKeeper is a backend application aimed at managing textual notes. It provides a RESTful API for users to create, read, update, and delete notes. This project exclusively uses Express.js for the backend and MongoDB as the database to store the notes. Additionally, it implements a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate the testing, building, and deployment process of the application to Heroku.

## Development
### Initialization
Set up the development environment for Express.js and MongoDB.
Create a GitHub repository for the project to host the source code and utilize GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
Main Features
RESTful API
Build an API with Express.js to handle CRUD operations on notes.
Each note includes a title, content, and timestamps for creation and last modification.
Data Model
Use Mongoose to define the data model for notes, facilitating interactions with MongoDB.
Request Validation
Implement validation of incoming requests to ensure that the data provided for notes is valid before processing.
### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
#### Automated Tests
Configure GitHub Actions to run automated tests (unit and integration tests) on each push or pull request to the main branch, ensuring code integrity and feature non-regression.
#### Automatic Deployment
Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of the application to Heroku whenever changes are merged into the main branch.
### Deployment
Prepare and configure the application on Heroku, including setting up MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage of notes.
Configure environment variables on Heroku to secure sensitive information such as database connection strings.
